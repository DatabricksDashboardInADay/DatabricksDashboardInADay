3. Sign up with GitHub or Google.

## Step 2 – Clone This Repo & Set Up the Workshop with Lab 0

**Clone the GitHub repository into your Databricks workspace**.

### ✅ Instructions
1. In Databricks, go to the sidebar and select **Workspace**.
2. Navigate to your desired folder (e.g., under your username).
3. Click **Create > Git folder**.
4. Enter the current URL: e.g., `https://github.com/DatabricksDashboardInADay/DatabricksDashboardInADay.git`
5. Click **Create**.
6. Expand the repo folder and open the `Lab 0` notebook in the folder `labs`.

## Step 3 – Choose Your Starting Point
**Decide where to start the workshop**.

### ✅ Instructions
Once Lab 0 has finished deploying the initial assets, you can decide where you want to start the workshop. Because Lab 0 pre-deploys the necessary Spark Declarative Pipelines, Metric View (`sm_fact_coffee_sales_fallback`), and AI/BI Dashboards (`[Final] Sunny Bay Roastery - Sales Report`), you have the flexibility to skip ahead to the topics that interest you most.
